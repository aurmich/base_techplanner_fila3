# Memento AI - Session 2

## Key Learnings and Changes

1. **Client Resource Management**:
   - Enhanced the `ClientResource` with additional fields for better client management.
   - Implemented sorting and filtering based on proximity using the `distance` field.

2. **Geo Actions Integration**:
   - Utilized geo actions from the GEO module to calculate travel time and distance accurately.

3. **File Structure and Dependencies**:
   - Investigated missing files and potential renames in the Xot module.
   - Ensured all necessary files and dependencies are correctly configured.

## Next Steps

- Continue refining the client management features.
- Verify the existence and correct placement of all necessary files in the project structure.

## Notes

- The file `XotBaseListRecords.php` was not found; a file named `XotBaseListRecords.old` was located instead.
- Consider checking for any recent changes or renames in the project structure.
