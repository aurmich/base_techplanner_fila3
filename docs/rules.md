# Naming Conventions for Actions

- **Action Naming**: Actions should have descriptive names that clearly indicate their functionality. For example, an action that retrieves coordinates from a full address should be named `GetCoordinatesDataByFullAddressAction` instead of `PopulateCoordinatesAction`.

- **Strong Typing**: Ensure all methods in actions are strongly typed, specifying parameter types and return types explicitly.

- **Error Handling**: Implement persistent notifications for errors to ensure users are informed of any issues.

These guidelines help maintain clarity and robustness in code design and implementation.
