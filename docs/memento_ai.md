1. **Client Resource Management**:
   - Added fields to the `ClientResource` for a comprehensive client management experience.
   - Included fields like `name`, `fiscal_code`, `address`, `city`, `province`, `country`, `phone`, and `email`.
   - Utilized the `full_address` mutator to display a complete address in the client list.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - Developed and executed the `UpdateClientCoordinatesCommand` to update client coordinates in bulk.
   - Ensured proper error handling and logging for the command execution.

3. **File Structure and Organization**:
   - Corrected file paths for actions and ensured they are placed in the correct directories as per the module's `composer.json` configuration.

4. **PHPStan Analysis**:
   - Resolved syntax errors and merge conflicts to ensure smooth static analysis.

## Enhancements in Client List View

- **Distance Field**: Added as the first column in the client list to prioritize sorting by proximity.
- **Travel Time**: Implemented description for the distance field to show travel time in minutes by car.
- **Column Merging**: Merged columns from `getTableColumns` and `getListTableColumns` for a comprehensive view.
- **Removed Redundancy**: Removed `getTableColumns` method to streamline column management.

## Geo Actions Integration

- Utilized geo actions from the GEO module to calculate distance and travel time accurately.

## Next Steps

- Continue enhancing client management features and ensure all relevant data is displayed.
- Maintain documentation for all changes to facilitate future development and troubleshooting.
